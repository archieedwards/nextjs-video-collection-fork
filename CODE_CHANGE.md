# Code Change: Enhancing Video Creation with Smart Tagging

## Context

Our video collection platform currently allows users to browse and search through educational content. We've recently added a new create page, but it's not yet connected to our backend. We want to streamline the video creation process and make it easier for content creators to properly categorize their content.

## Problem Statement

Content creators are spending too much time manually tagging their videos, and sometimes they miss important categories that could help with discoverability. Additionally, the current create form is not functional, preventing creators from adding new content to the platform.

## Proposed Changes

### Phase 1: Enable Video Creation

**Goal**: Allow creators to add new videos to our platform through the create form.

**Requirements**:

- Connect the create form to our database
- Required fields: title and description
- Use this placeholder thumbnail for all new videos: `https://picsum.photos/seed/video1/300/200`
- Initialize with an empty tags array
- After successful creation, redirect to the home page where the new video should appear

**Technical Notes**:

- The create form is already built with HeroUI components
- Our backend uses Prisma with SQLite
- The video schema is already set up in the database

### Phase 2: Smart Video Tagging

**Goal**: Automatically generate relevant tags for videos based on their content.

**Requirements**:

- Integrate with OPEN AI to create tags based on video title and description
- Automatically generate appropriate tags based on the content
- Tags should be relevant to our video education platform context
- Generated tags should follow our existing tag patterns (e.g., "tutorial", "beginner", "video editing")

**Technical Notes**:

- You'll be provided with an OPEN AI API key and will need to craft a prompt to generate tags
- Keep existing form UX - tag generation should happen on the backend

## Success Criteria

- Users can successfully create new videos through the form
- Created videos appear in the main video grid
- Generated tags are relevant to the video content
- The process feels seamless from the user's perspective
